# Function-Approximation
I implement a function approximator with the help of genetic programming. In this project I only use simple functions such as:
+ +(addition)
+ -(subtraction)
+ *(multiplication)
+ /(division)
+ ^(exponentiation)
+ cos(x) and sin(x)

The picture below is the first approximation of the program for the x*cos(x) function:

There is a little error in the results. (the blue one is an approximation and the red one is an exact function). The picture below is another approximation for x*cos(x):

![xcosx2](https://github.com/aminh7325/Function-Approximation/blob/main/Files/xcosx2.png)

As you see, both are the same and depict it with black color.

To provide a complex example, we give our program a discrete function, and below are the results:
